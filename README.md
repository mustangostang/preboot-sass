preboot-sass
============

A port of [Preboot 2](https://github.com/mdo/preboot) to [SASS](http://sass-lang.com). Preboot by @mdo is a collection of LESS mixins and variables for quickly writing CSS.

## Getting started

* Create a new SASS file (e.g., application.scss)
* Include Preboot via @import: "preboot"
* Start writing your own SASS-flavored CSS

@mdo highly recommends using Preboot in conjunction with [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css), a powerful tool for more consistent rendering of web components across various browsers and devices.
